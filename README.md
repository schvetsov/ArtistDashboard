## Technologies Used

I used React, Redux, Axios, Material-UI, Jest, and Enzyme.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4) 
to generate the scaffolding for this app.

## Assignment Requirements

API is called using componentDidMount lifecycle method to get 
initial list.

When each item on the list is clicked, it triggers another API call 
which brings data into the detailed view.

## Bonus Requirements

Unit and integration tests done with Jest and Enzyme.
